# ethos-pathos-legos
Think of it this way: there are three ways one can argue a case: (1) by presenting yourself as an authority on the subject (ethos), (2) by convincing the listener that you have good intentions (pathos), and (3) by building a logical case based on objective evidence (logos).

A problem with using ethos (1) and pathos (2) to persuade is that you can convince people of your position even if you're wrong. However, logos (3) only works if you're right (or tricky enough to fool people with bad evidence and faulty logic).
The argument in favor of evolution rests on logos (3), and it has been tested exhaustively to ensure that nobody is pulling a con job. And for people who don't have the scientific expertise to judge for themselves, it's backed by strong ethos (thousands of professional scientists around the  world) and respectable pathos (sure, a few of those thousands are jerks, but most are decent, respectable people like you and me, people who care about others, value truth, and who would be risking their professional reputations and their jobs if they were to lie about their work). It's a very strong argument.
I think it's important for scientists and atheists to realize something when debating creationists and fundamentalists: they aren’t being disingenuous or dishonest when they question your authority and credibility rather than leaping to examine the evidence. The Christian worldview emphasizes faith as the proper means of knowing truth, and skepticism and my desire for evidence as a crisis of faith. Christians naturally examine arguments (especially arguments that touch on their faith) by considering the credibility and moral authority of the speaker
This is also why Christians talk about whether or not they should "decide to believe” in evolution. Accepting an argument on ethos and pathos alone is an expression of trust in the speaker. It is an act of faith. Christians who consider "deciding to believe" in evolution are not evaluating the logical argument for evolution at all. They are considering whether they have enough trust in those who argue for it to just take it on faith.
This is the motivation for many fundamentalist/creationist arguments against evolution (especially an atheistic view of evolution). The arguments are not aimed at the theory of evolution itself, but directed against the credentials (ethos) and motives (pathos) of those who argue for the theory:
It's only a theory (ethos)
scientific "truths" are always being corrected (ethos)
Atheism is a religion too (ethos)
You can’t really know because you weren’t there/you’ve never seen evolution happen (ethos)
It takes as much faith to believe in Darwin as it does to believe in creation (ethos)
Scientists are blinded by their worship of Darwin (pathos)
Atheists use evolution as an excuse to rebel against God's authority (pathos)
I come against thee, Satan! The Word of God is true! (pathos/ethos)
Evolution is a “theory in crisis" (ethos)
Evidence x in support of evolution was revealed to be a hoax (pathos)
Evolutionary scientists want to admit that evolution is false but are afraid they’ll lose their jobs if they tell the truth (pathos)
Without a literal understanding of the Bible there is no basis for morality (pathos)
Without a literal understanding of the Bible there is no basis for logic or science (ethos) Darwin invented evolution because he was a bitter, disaffected Christian (pathos) Added by suggestion of:
In particular when discussing creation vs. evolution, the pastor who lives in the local area and socializes with his church-goers, cares for his flock, conducts himself like Jesus, and preaches the forgiveness of sins has tremendous authority and trustworthiness when speaking to
Christians about the creation account in the Bible. Atheistic scientists from some liberal coastal university who want to talk about evolution start in a massive hole in terms of authority and trustworthiness with Bible Belt Christians, and never realize that they need to climb out of that hole before they can even begin to present their logical arguments.
